# About page

My name is Thomas Thorkildsen and I am currently working as a data analyst in Oslo
focusing on data processing and database related topics for the energy sector.

Outside of that my main technical interests are within databases, financial and economical modeling, statistical analysis, data processing and video games.

My educational background is in financial data analysis and economics.

Otherwise, I mostly enjoy running, playing piano and video games in my spare time.

This page reflects those interests, alongside anything else I find interesting.
I am mostly writing to enhance my understanding of different subjects and because I enjoy the pedagogical aspects of it.
