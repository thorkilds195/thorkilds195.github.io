Indexes using SSMS:
    What are indexes
    How are they made
    What is happening under the hood
    What kind of indexes exists
    When to use which ones
    Graphs showing performance of update, insert and retrievel time under different indexes
    Important to show how it evolves over time

Writing a simple database from scratch:
    REPL
    Commands
    Data storage
    Binary format
    Cursor
    Statements

Writing a dataframe like functionality from scratch (i.e. pandas):
    For example in pure python, show how to implement core pandas functionality
    Will give insights into type inference, aggregation functions, group bys, joins etc
    Columns and indexes are the main thing that also should exist to let data be fetched

Linear optimization:
    What is linear optimization and linear programming
    Using pyomo models in practice for linear optimization
    Show an interesting day to day problem and how we can solve it
    Show how we can add more constraints to the problem

Pensions and the impact of risk weighting over time:
    Assume some lognormal random walk with drift
    Run simulations and show how different weights with different time periods behave
    Show why index funds are optimal

Index funds versus active:
    Gather data on index funds and active funds and show gains versus costs historically
    Should show how active funds shut-down when doing poorly and how index funds are optimal decision
    Argue for index funds plus risk free activa where possible

Modeling basic economical principles and simulating it:

Writing a SSMS driver from scratch to be used with python:
